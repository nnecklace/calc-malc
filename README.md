CalcMalc is simple arthemetic REPL (Read, Evaluate, Parse, Loop). CalcMalc can read any normal arthemetic expression, such as `2+2`, and it should also support a handful of other mathematical functions: `log, ln, sqrt, max, min, abs`. You should also be able to create your own temporary values, variables and functions, and be able to reuse them thourghout the process's lifetime. The project is written in Java and all documents and code will be written in English.
