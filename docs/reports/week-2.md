# Week Report 2

Hours spent: 11

Wish I had more time this week to work on this project. This week was a lot of ground work. The course guide recommended not the start with your own data structures, I saw that it would be the best option to create them first. Also got a really barebones version of the main algorithm to work. At this time it only recognizes really simple inputs and only inputs with spaces between all characters. This is a major bug that needs to be fixed in the next version. 

I created a stack, queue, and list data structure. All have been written, tested and are now in use in my application.

Unnecessary time went to fighting vscode this week. For some reason, java extensions don't work with TabNine. 

What I learned this week is that java doesn't allow generic type arrays. Also learned how to create, from scratch, all the above mentioned data structures. Also, learned how to Shunting Yard algorithm works and how I can modify it to accept a broader array of inputs.

Unclear at this point is what actually is unclear :) I'm optimistic about my project so far. Not still quite sure how to make the syntax checking at runtime and if I need any tree structures, most probably will though. Still some uncertainty how I should parse something like `f(x,y) = 2 * x + y / 4`.

Next up is lexing and fixing the algorithm to accept mathematical functions, like: abs, log, sqrt, etc...
