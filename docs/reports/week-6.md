## Week 6

Hours spent: 8 - 10h

Didn't have much time to work on this project this week. Had to move, was sick, and then my internet didn't work...

I did however manage to write the code review, testing document and implementation document. Also, refactored the code. Removed the verbose token classes and my an enum instead out of them, looks and works really nicely. Also wrote more unit tests, currently 147, the amount doesn't really matter but I hope I've covered all possible edge cases.

Up next would be the GUI. Going super simple with the design. Also will write a proper manual for CalcMalc.
Hope I still have time to chat with Hannu or Saska about the space complexity, didn't have time this week because chaos.

I learned that CalcMalc is suprisingly fast. When writing the testing document I made performance tests, and apparently it took CalcMalc on average 2 seconds to evaluate input files `n = 2*10^6`. I was pleasantly surprised.

All in all enjoyed this project a lot.
